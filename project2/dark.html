        <p style="padding-right:18% ;">Al Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock are two separate things that most people mix
            up. Today, we are coming up
            with a blog that clarifies the difference between these two places.</p>
        <p style="padding-right:18% ;">There are lots of confusions between lots of things, places and many more. And
            the confusion between Masjid
            Al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock is one of them. Most of the people said both are the same places because they
            are located in the same city but we should know that Islamic history is different for both. </p>

        <p>So, here we are going to explain the history of both to let you know that both have different places and
            history. </p>
        <h2> <b> Al Aqsa Mosque </b></h2>
        <p>Al Aqsa Mosque is also known as Bait-ul-Muqaddas. This mosque is located in Jerusalem the old city. It was
            the first Qibla of Muslims before Mecca. It is the holiest place for Muslims as well as for people of
            another religion. It was built by Suleman. The Al Aqsa Mosque is located on the Temple Mount, referred to by
            Muslims today as the “Haram al-Sharif with silver doom and four Minarets. Our prophet (PBUH) visit Miraj
            from this mosque.</p>
        <h3 class="quote inset"> And Allah says in Quran: <br> ⟪Glorified be He (Allah) Who took His slave (muhammad)
            for a
            journey by night from Al-Haraam (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsaa, the neighborhood whereof We have blessed,
            in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayaah ⟫ </h3>
        <h2><b>Dome of the Rock:</b></h2>
        <p>The Doom of Rock also known as Qubbat as-Sakhra. Is an Islamic shrine located on Temple Mount in the Old City
            of Jerusalem? The Dome of the Rock was built by the caliph ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan in 72 AH. However, both
            these buildings are within the enclosure of Haraam as-Shareef (The Noble Sanctuary), referred to as “the
            Furthest Mosque” in Sura’ al-Israa’, verse 1. Mujir ad-Din al-Hanbali, in his book Al-Uns Al-Jaleel, writes
            that:</p>
        <h3 class="quote inset" >It is common among people that Aqsa is the one located towards the Qibla, the mosque
            constructed in the foremost area including the pulpit and the big mihrab (prayer niche), while the trust is
            that the Aqsa is the name of all what is within its compound inside the walls the building in the foremost
            area and others, Dome of the Rock, corridors and others, the Aqsa means all that is within the walls.</h3>
        <p>So, the whole plateau is called Aqsa that’s why people can’t distinguish between both of them. Both are
            different buildings of different structures. And both are in Haram Sharif.</p>
            <div id="aqsaa" style="margin-bottom: 3%;margin-top:0px;"><br></div>
           
        <h2 >History of El-Aqsaa:</h2>
        <p><b>Pre-construction site</b></p>
        <img style=" padding:10px; border-radius: 25px;" src="Jerusalem-2013(2)-Aerial-Temple_Mount-(south_exposure).jpg" alt="Palastine">
        <p>The mosque is located on the Temple Mount, referred to by Muslims today as the "Haram al-Sharif" ("Noble
            Sanctuary"), an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE.</p>
        <p>The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to
            overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into
            the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. At the time of the Second Temple, the present site of the mosque was
            occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure. The Royal Stoa was
            destroyed along with the Temple during the sacking of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.</p>
        <p>It was once thought that Emperor Justinian's "Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos", lit. the New Church of the
            God-Bearer and commonly known as the Nea Church, dedicated to the God-bearing Virgin Mary, consecrated in
            543, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the
            Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they
            are made from Lebanese cedar and cypress. Radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages, some as old as 9th
            century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings. However,
            reexamination of the same beams in the 2010s gave dates in the Byzantine period.</p>
        <p>During his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with
            geometric patterns, but didn't publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers
            that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later
            Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the
            Temple Mount's southern wall.</p>
