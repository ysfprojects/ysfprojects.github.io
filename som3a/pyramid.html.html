<h2><ins>History of Pyramids</ins></h2>

<p>The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and
 constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BC), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren)
 a few hundred metres to the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of 
Menkaure (or Mykerinos) a few hundred metres farther south-west. The Great Sphinx 
lies on the east side of the complex. Current consensus among Egyptologists is
 that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of Khafre. Along with these major 
monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, causeways and valley pyramids</p>

<div  id="khufu" style="margin-bottom: 4%;margin-top:0px;"><br></div>
<h2><ins>khufu</ins></h2>

<p>Khufu, Greek Cheops, (flourished 25th century BCE), second king of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 BCE) of Egypt and builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza (see Pyramids of Giza), the largest single building to that time.<br><br>
Khufu’s reign and that of his son Khafre were represented by the Greek historian Herodotus as 106 years of oppression and misery, but this was belied by Khufu’s posthumous reputation in Egypt as a wise ruler. Herodotus’s story of Khufu’s prostitution of his daughter in order to raise money for his building projects is clearly apocryphal.</p>
	
	<button onclick="myFunction3()" id="read7">read more</button>
<p id="read8" style="display:none;">Although few written sources remain, it is known that Khufu was the son and successor of King Snefru and his queen Hetepheres and was probably married four times: to Merityetes, who was buried in one of the three small pyramids beside his own; to a second queen, whose name is unknown; to Henutsen, whose small pyramid is the third of the group; and to Nefert-kau, the eldest of Snefru’s daughters. Two of his sons, Redjedef and Khafre, succeeded him in turn.</p><br><br>

<h2><ins>khafra</ins></h2>

<p>Khafre Pyramid is the second largest pyramid in Egypt, only about 10 meters lower than the Great Pyramid. The pyramid is unique in that the remains of the original cladding have been preserved in its upper part.

Khafra built his pyramid at Giza next to his father’s pyramid… Its pyramid complex is better preserved than others, thanks in part to an innovative construction method using massive limestone blocks enclosed in a sheath of thin facing slabs. The entire complex served as a temple for the resurrected god-pharaoh after his funeral.<br><br>
The pyramid was likely opened and robbed during the First Intermediate Period. During the Nineteenth Dynasty, the overseer of temple construction took casing stones to build a temple in Heliopolis on Ramesses II's orders.[citation needed].<br><br>

Arab historian Ibn Abd al-Salam recorded that the pyramid was opened in 1372 AD. On the wall of the burial chamber, there is an Arabic graffito that probably dates from the same time.<br><br>

It is not known when the rest of the casing stones were robbed; they were presumably still in place by 1646, when John Greaves, professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford in his Pyramidographia, wrote that, while its stones were not as large or as regularly laid as in Khufu's, the surface was smooth and even free of breaches or inequalities, except on the south.<br><br>

The pyramid was first explored in modern times by Giovanni Belzoni on March 2, 1818, when the original entrance was found on the north side. Belzoni had hopes of finding an intact burial but the chamber was empty except for an open sarcophagus and its broken lid on the floor.</p>

<p id="read6" style="display:none;">The first complete exploration was conducted by John Perring in 1837. In 1853, Auguste Mariette partially excavated Khafre's valley temple, and, in 1858, while completing its clearance, he managed to discover a diorite statue of Khafre.</p><br><br>

<h2><ins>menkaure</ins></h2>

<p>Menkaure built his pyramid beside the great pyramid of Khufu and the pyramid of Khafre at Giza. He seems to have intended his pyramid to be the last great monument built at the site as the placement of his valley temple at the mouth of the main wadi would have made further major building works at the site problematic.<br><br>
Although his pyramid, named “Menkaure is divine”, is the smallest of the three pyramids of Giza, it is still one of the most impressive monuments of Ancient Egypt.<br><br>
There was a great deal of debate in antiquity regarding the pharaoh responsible for this pyramid. Herodotus suggested that it was built for heteara Rhodopis – the original Cinderella who was a Greek slave who was given rose-gilded slippers and married pharaoh Ahmose I. However, Manetho attributed it to Nitokris, the daughter of Psamtik I of the twenty sixth dynasty (Saite period Third Intermediate Period) of Ancient Egypt. Diodorus Siculus correctly attributed the pyramid to Menkaure.<br><br>
Statues found inside the pyramid complex of Menkaure are among the finest recovered from any Old Kingdom site. The statues discovered in his valley temple suggest that it was dedicated to Ra, Hathor and Horus. When Menkaure died, his successor (who was probably also his son) Shepseskaf completed his pyramid complex and recorded his actions on the wall of the valley temple.</p>

<p id="read4" style="display:none;">During the twelfth century, the second Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt (al-Malek al-Aziz, son of Saladin) tried to demolish the pyramids of Giza starting with the pyramid of Menkaure. Thankfully, the blocks forming the pyramid were so huge and cumbersome that in eight months they had made little progress and he gave up. Unfortunately, he did manage to leave an unsightly gash in the masonry on the north face of the pyramid.</p><br><br>

<div id="Djoser" style="margin-bottom: 4%;margin-top:0px;"><br></div>
<h2><ins>Djoser</ins></h2>

<p>The Pyramid of Djoser (or Djeser and Zoser), or Step Pyramid, is an archaeological site in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt, northwest of the city of Memphis. The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration. Its architect was Imhotep, chancellor of the pharaoh and high priest of the god Ra.<br><br>

The pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 m (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone. The step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man as of 1997, although the nearby enclosure wall "Gisr el-Mudir" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.<br><br>
Djoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (c. 2670–2650 BC) of the Egyptian Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2125 BC). He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years. He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime.<br><br>

Djoser is best known for his innovative tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors thousands of years later. Djoser's step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.<br><br>

The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering. The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at Abydos.</p>

	<button onclick="myFunction()" id="read2">read more</button>
<p id="read" style="display:none;">Although the plan of Djoser's pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such, most Egyptologists attribute Djoser's vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex.</p><br><br>
